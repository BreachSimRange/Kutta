# Kutta Simple Payload Sharing Server
![Kutta Logo](images/kutta-logo.jpg)

**Kutta** is a lightweight, responsive web-based file sharing server written in **Go**.
It was created to use during our trainings to move, payloads and code snippets across machines in the lab environment.
It is an alternative tool for python http.server, motivated from tools like `goshs` and `updog`, with extra features.
I had a loyal indie dog named 'Kuttan' when I was a kid. Meaning in Malayalam language would be 'Boy'\'Good boy'. 'Kutta' in Hindi language would mean, 'Dog".

## Features

* **Directory Browsing** - Navigate and download files/folders
* **File Upload** - Drag & drop, file picker, or `curl` uploads
* **Deletion** - Delete uploaded files (never touches existing system files)
* **Clipboard** - Add, clear, and export snippets as JSON
* **Security** - Read-only / Upload-only / Auth modes
* **Download and Execute Cradles** - Predefined list of cradles to make life easier
* **Embedded UI** - Dark theme, responsive design
* **Service Ready** - Install as a `systemd` service
